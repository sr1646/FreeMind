## Bluray improvement
 
###completed
Want to create database where i can store temprary vedeo i.e. not realy moved anywhere but it will store file info.

So whenever I wanted to move them to blu-ray I can move them. i.e. i will copy these file to folder and then img burn will burn them.

##VLC meadia player improvement
VLC player want to add the move and copy button
The bar of add folder and move copy button should be on top
There should be shorcut key i.e. 
for adding folder --> x
For accessing first 0-9 folder numeric key

when opening folder if we are not opening folder do not reset existing playing play list

Open windhow should remember last place we have opened
